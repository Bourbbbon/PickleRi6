# PickleRi6: The [Mee6](https://github.com/cookkkie/mee6) Fork.

## So, this is a Mee6 copy?
Not exactly. Yes, we use code written by cookkkie from Mee6, but we've also added in our own features. 

## Mee6/PickleRi6 uses:

- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- [discord.ie](https://github.com/qeled/discordie)
- [aioredis](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis)
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Are you apart of the Mee6 team? !

If you're apart of the Mee6 team, and you'd like this bot removed from GitHub & shutdown, no problem! Just message me: DidUJustHitDat#4778 on discord. I'd be more than happy to remove it if you want me to.

This is not affiliated with [adult swim], cookkkie, Mee6 or Discord.
All code with the: I've turned myself into a discord bot morty isn't coded by me, and is 100% coded by members of the Mee6 team (copyright Cookkkiem, 2016) but anything with another commit name, was coded by me.
